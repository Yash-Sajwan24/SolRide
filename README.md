# Problem Statement

- Data privacy in today’s world is a great concern. However, there are various applications which involves user’s and servicemen data transfer to the central hubs (like Ola, Uber etc.). This transfer of data to the central hubs could also lead to data breaching and misuse of data in other ways. So this application would reduce the chances of Data Breaching or misuse of data.
- Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) significantly influences traffic management and street security by furnishing intelligent vehicles with advanced materials, for example, cloud computing, information stockpiling, traffic management, and decision making.
- If the information is changed by a hacking attack, the framework will show the block which has been altered and after altered blocks, Blockchain will go to the invalid state. This guarantees greater security and reduces the time to revalidate information.
